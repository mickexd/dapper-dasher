# dapper-dasher

Dapper dahser is a simple game where obstacles appear and you need to jump until you reach the finish line. 

This is only a prototype that explains physics on 2D side scrolling games. 

The project can be taken as a blueprint for more complicated 2D side scroller games. 

When in game press SPACEBAR to jump
